<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Martyn</h1>
<h3 align="center">I am a passionate Full Stack Web Developer.</h3>

- :computer: Iâ€™m currently working on [Laravel Dashboard](https://github.com/MartynHorslen/laravel-dashboard).

- :green_book: I am training with [Netmatters](https://www.netmatters.co.uk/train-for-a-career-in-tech) as a Web Developer on their Scion Coalition Scheme. I am currently studying the Laravel framework. I am also aligned with a development team within Netmatters where I am gaining valuable client testing experience - and soon to be carrying out Junior Developer tasks. 

- :notebook: Iâ€™ve recently paused study on a **'Back-End Engineer'** course on **Codecademy.com** to focus on the aforementioned training. I plan to return and complete this at a future date. ([Codecademy Profile](https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/martynhorslen))

**Completed Projects:**<br />
:heavy_check_mark: [Netmatters Reflection](https://github.com/MartynHorslen/Netmatters) - This started as a HTML & Sass recreation of the Netmatters homepage. After studying JavaScript & jQuery, this project was updated to include a sticky header, animated sidebar and an image carousel/slider. <br />
The latest update introduced PHP & SQL on a new contacts page which provided server-side validation before entering a contact form into a MySQL database. The contacts page also included a JavaScript map plugin. All three projects were completed to a high standard before the deadlines.

:heavy_check_mark: [Portfolio Project](https://github.com/MartynHorslen/Portfolio) - My portfolio was my second project of my Netmatters training and was updated in sync with the Netmatters Reflection as I have progressed my skills.

:heavy_check_mark: [JavaScript Array Project](https://github.com/MartynHorslen/image-search) - This project was to fetch JSON data from a third party API and create an application that would allow a user to store an image. The application was to also return stored images back to the user on request, sorted by the email address they were stored by. <br />
I took this project as an opportunity to challenge myself to use a few skills I hadn't used in the previous projects and to push my creativity to create a project that might stand out from others on the Scion Coalition Scheme. First was the use of the CSS Grid - I had previously used Flexbox. Secondly, I wanted to explore jQuery animations further. Finally I tested jQuery's AJAX methods thoroughly until I understood them.
